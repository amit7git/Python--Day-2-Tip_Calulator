# Day 2 – Tip Calculator 💸

Part of my **100 Days of Python Projects** challenge.  
This project recreates the classic Python Tip Calculator using a terminal-style web interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Tip Calculator determines how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a chosen tip percentage.

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Handling user input dynamically in a terminal-style UI
- Performing type conversion and mathematical operations
- Formatting numbers to two decimal places
- Structuring reusable UI across multiple projects

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. User enters the total bill amount  
2. User selects a tip percentage (10, 12, or 15)  
3. User enters the number of people  
4. The app calculates and displays the amount each person should pay  

---

## 💡 Code Highlights
- Capturing multiple user inputs step by step
- Converting string inputs into numbers for calculations
- Applying percentage-based calculations
- Rounding and formatting output for currency display

## 🧪 Example
    Welcome to the tip calculator!
    What was the total bill? $150
    How much tip would you like to give? 10
    How many people to split the bill? 5
    Each person should pay: $33.00
