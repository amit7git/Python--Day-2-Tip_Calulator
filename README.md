# Day 2 – Tip Calculator 💸

Part of my **100 Days of Python Projects** challenge.  
This project recreates the classic Python tip calculator using a **terminal-style web interface**.

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Translating **Python logic into JavaScript**
- Handling **user input dynamically** in a terminal-style UI
- Performing **type conversion and mathematical operations**
- Formatting numbers to **2 decimal places**
- Structuring reusable UI across multiple projects

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Bill Split Calculator determines how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a chosen tip percentage.

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. User enters the total bill amount
2. User selects a tip percentage (10, 12, or 15)
3. User enters the number of people
4. The app calculates and displays the amount each person should pay
